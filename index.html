    <p class="white-text col-xs-12"> Roberto Clemente Walker was not only an amazing baseball player but a great humanitarian and a national hero. On December 23rd 1972, a massive earthquake affected Managua, Nicaragua. He started making emergency relief arrangements immediately and on December 31st 1972, he took off from the San Juan, Puerto Rico airport to Managua to help with the crisis. Moments after taking off his plane crashed in the Atlantic ocean. To honor his memory, the MLB named the award for humanitarian of the year as the "Roberto Clemente Award".</p>
